The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday.\\t\\tThe beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.\",\n",

There is a slight sweetness from the malt as well.\\t\\tTaste: Very light and refreshing. The ginger shows up right away and then fades towards the finish of the sip. The finish is malty and bread like. \\t\\tMouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with smooth carbonation and a very dry finish.\\t\\tOverall: This is a light and refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular.

Not the smokiest or most pungent smoke profile I've experienced, but damn up there. and I think it's the intense rich malt and sweetness from the malt that keeps the smoke slightly tamed. A touch of lemon and citrus fruitiness in the finish which blends perfectly with the cherry smoke.\\t\\tIt's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it. I'm digging it. \\t\\tI'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing. I think this is probably my favorite domestically produced Rauchbier I've had the pleasure of tasting. It really hits on all cylinders. A touch sweet and malt forward, but all in all, it does what it's going for and works beautifully. Definitely worth seeking out.\",\n",

Both cherry and beechwood were used, but I'm getting mostly cherry in the nose. \\t\\tTaste is really quite smokey, the beechwood really asserting itself here, although the sweetness of the cherry wood and the malt is no slouch either. The smoke has a sharp phenolic quality that I get from peat, but with the sweetness I think it works well. Note it's not cloying, the sweetness is enjoyable and provides relative balance. \\t\\tMouthfeel is slick, some softness, a medium bodied, and smooth. Nice. \\t\\tDrinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful. I have to say, this was really good, and with just a touch less phenols, would be up a notch easily.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This beer pours a very clear and attractive shade of ruby brown. Much less dark than I had anticipated, and carrying a diminutive, but attractive head of parchment foam that leaves very nice lace. The smoky aroma of this beer is very nice. It smells like the smoke that would waft from the smoker at a little restaurant in my home town of Traverse City, Michigan. Porky, sweet and delectable with notes of brown sugar. I suddenly have a huge craving for an \"all meat mess.\" The flavor is also quite nice in that the smoke is not too overpowering. Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good. Surprisingly drinkable, and would be great (of course) with BBQ. Not the first smoked beer I have had, but the first I have reviewed. This one makes me want to seek out more.',\n",

What remains is a broken swirl of film and a creamy ring. Decent streaming carbonation.\\t\\tS: Lovely of savory smoke and sugared spiciness...a malty, caramel-laden lager covered gently with grainy husks, burnt yet surprisingly sweet. Strong enough to be smelled from 1-foot away in a crowded room. \\t\\tT: Toffee and spice (notable cinnamon) with a candied fruit after-effect. Oh yeah, a good deal of smoke - a sweet mesquite, reminiscent of barbecued brisket. Herbed and a little tang in the finish. Enough intonations of fruit and a fleeting tartness.\\t\\tM: Velvety feel with a slight prickle (less from carbonation, more from an earthy ground spice). Medium body that borders on heaviness (not unexpected: it IS over 7%). Maltiness coats but isn't cloying; smoke doesn't intrude too much. \\t\\tD: Despite a heavenly aroma and feel and good flavor, this 'only' can muster a 4.0, simply due to a hefty alcohol girth.

Cool green tab but sadly no canning or best by date.\\t\\tPours a nice rich gold with a pure white head that grows excessively. Slow pour down a tilted glass and cannot even get the whole can into a pint glass. The retention is good, however, and lacing is great. Lots of bubbles cascading upwards from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is mild and consists of a bit of hoppy earthiness and some candied oranges.\\t\\tThe flavor starts with a mild hops bittering and quickly adds a touch of sweetness to balance it out. Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles.\\t\\tA simple beer, but not really in a good way.

Single purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $2.15.\\t\\tA: Honey-orange with solid 2-finger ivory head with decent retention and only a crown of lace.\\t\\tS: Plenty of hops in this one with above-average pale malt backbone with leafy and grapefruit aromas dominating.\\t\\tT: The flavor is good but a touch flat for the style, owing mainly to the lack of character in the maltload. The malt component is not quite sweet or roasted enough, which leaves a somewhat bland quality to this aspect. The hops are highly bitter and pretty harsh: a little more floral and citrus character would blend better with the ambiguous malting. Motwithstanding, this is an above-average APA without a doubt.\\t\\tM: Feel is a little thin for the style, although not far off with a medium-light body. Carbonation is a bit too short in supply. The aftertaste is very long with bitter and leafy hops notes persisting.\\t\\tD: A pretty good APA with a big price tag relatively. Solid and highly bitter for the style and could use a little more finesse. Still, enjoyable and didn't last long.\",\n",

Smells like a pale ale. \\t\\tThis is a nice brew. The flavor is present & accounted for without being overwhelming. I think this would be a superb gateway beer for a BMC drinker - there's not so much flavor to cause anyone to drop their Coors Light & run screaming, but it has enough for us dedicated beer freaks to have a sip & go...mmm. That's nice. The lighter flavor, I've noticed, encourages bigger sips, & I'm trying not to gulp this one down too fast. It's a long night. Pace yourself. \\t\\tDid I hear session beer? This would be a great beer to find on tap at the local pub, tasty, easy-drinking, but with a low enough ABV that you're not playing bumper cars in the lot after three of them.

I love the town it comes from - Ashland, Oregon - and I thought to myself that a place like Ashland must have the creative spirit to produce something unique. Well, this beer was unique, alright. I can't recall ever drinking another beer with a hop flavor like boiled vegetables. Blech! Appearance was average, and head retention was so-so. I noticed no lacing whatsoever. Smell did not reveal what the taste had in store. On first sip, I noticed nothing immediately untoward, but as the hop flavor built so did the unwelcome overcooked-vegetable flavor. I tried another can the next day thinking that maybe I just had a bad one, but with the same result. I'm afraid I won't be trying this one again, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else. You could do worse, but to me this beer would be a last resort before having to accept a macrobrew.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Had Dale's Pale Ale for the first time yesterday, and thought I'd compare it to this, both of which i picked up on a recent road trip.\\t\\tAt first glance this beer is a bit lighter than Dale's but remains a very good looking beverage, pouring a slightly hazed golden color with a large white head that lasts a while and leaves very impressive lacing. \\t\\tNose is very hoppy and bitter, quite a bit of citrus noticeable. More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. \\tBody is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. \\tFinal verdict? Another extremely drinkable brew, and another fantastic canned beer for my forays to the pool or wherever glass isn't allowed/convenient.\",\n",

The beer is a cloudy yellow with a nice head that fell after a couple of minutes. The smell is very malty for a APA and has a nice hint of floral hops. The taste is very well balance between malt and hops. Not overly bitter or hoppy, but right on for a pale ale. This a a very good interpretation of the style and unique with the nice malt presence. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and the drinkability is good a well. This woould make a very good session beer if it were regularly available to me.

This smells a bit less sweet than their amber but otherwise seems the same. The IPA smells a lot better.\\t\\tT. Sweet with some english/american grassy hops. These could be american hops but there's something very english tasting here. The hops finish with enough bite here which the smell and opening taste don't seems to hint at. \\t\\tD. Goes down easy and would be great on a hot day. \\t\\tM. A touch light on the carbination.

The hop flavor follows soon after but fails to assert itself enough to overcome the malt. Light grapefruit with a bit of a pithy bite. A brighter hop profile would do wonders hear.\\t\\tLight to medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Smooth texture. The finish is moderately dry, a bit of malt flavor does linger a bit.\\t\\tYes, this beer is very drinkable but it also falls short of my expectations for the style. The aroma and flavor are lacking for an APA, the attributes remind me much more of an english style. This is a beer I could see drinking a few during a barbecue or other social events. Decent session beer.',\n",

Big, rocky eggshell white head rises and clings to the glass with each sip leaving an absolutely beautiful lacing behind.\\t\\tAroma- Bright hop aromas of grapefruit, pithy orange peel, and slightly pungent pine. Healthy burnt sugar and sweet malty undertones with a whisper of mineral-like yeastiness. \\t\\tFlavor- Nice balance from start through the middle and into the finish with soft caramel/burnt sugar maltiness and a hearty pungent citrusy vein of hop goodness. Bitterness and hop pungency intensifies into finish and lingers well beyond the exhale with a kiss of cracker-like light malt. Very refreshing, crisp, and edgy pale ale! \\t\\tMouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, low-moderate residual sugars, moderate CO2. Nice balance, but definitely some sticky hoppiness to this brew. Refreshing with an edgy, pungent, minerally dryness in finish. \\t\\tOverall- This is ridiculously drinkable and just about everything you would want in a pale ale! Big hops, but nice dose of flavor, aroma, and bitterness in there. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to keep drinkability high. This would make an excellent lawnmower beer, but still has enough complexity/flavor to be a great pair with food- I'm thinking pulled pork and slaw, or anything spicy. I'll definitely grab more of this tasty nugget in a can!\",\n",

I'd leave it at that but I suppose a person wants to know a little more. A big sip delivers a bitter hoppy bite that is subdued calmly and respectably by a dose of malty medicine. Things are balanced and smooth with just a hint of sharpness in the finish. Love those cascade hops and the fact that this is a close 50/50 when it comes to the malt to hops flavor ratio. Great pale ale from the folks in Shakespeare land.\\t \\tOverall - I really enjoyed this pale ale. This is a very drinkable brew and I mean that in every way possible.

There is some grassy notes towards the end though, but this is a pale after all so it's in line.\\t\\tT- Caldera Pale Ale is a winner, A great balance between hops and malt with a little edge on the former. Just a little touch of a tropical fruit mix leading to a bready finish that's clean as a whistle. Not bitter at all but you can kind of feel the hops for about 1/2 a second.\\t\\tM- Easy on the mouth, this one is easy in all aspects of the word. A great balance that results in a feel that's not hoppy and not malt forward but somehow manages to meld greatly. Two notches above light with a small bite from the carb.\\t\\tD- As long as I can find this fairly fresh(no canning date), I will be drinking it.

People are sending me unsolicited BeerMails for trades for new CANs. Keep 'em coming, folks!\\t\\tAfter a seemingly steady diet there for a while of AmeriCAN macro lagers, it is nice to see and smell something decent glug-glug-glugging its way out of the CAN and into my glass. \\t\\tI caught two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention that was already beginning to leave a nice lace in its wake, following my pour. Color was a slightly-hazy honey-yellow. Remember, kids, clarity is overrated! Nose was grapefruit-citrusy. Pale Ale, bah! In many of our Central-Southern states, this would have been their IPA. I began to weep at the thought of previous recent CANs like Lone Star and Stack - rubbish in a CAN! Recovering, I took a sip and got a mouthful of full-on Cascade hops! Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! If this was simply their Pale Ale, it struck me as to why I loved their IPA in a CAN so much. I may have found a new favorite brewery for CANs... I allowed myself to luxuriate a little more fully in the second sip. It was very citrusy on the palate and even a little grainy, as though the liquid were saturated by hops. No matter, because on the swallow, it was so dry that I could not help but reach for another sip. More, please, sir.\",\n",

The orange flavor almost has a fresh taste to it. The malt taste to the beer is a bit nutty and chocolate like. There is a noticeable amount of Belgian yeast flavor. I get a tangy almost chalky flavor from the yeast. The yeast also seems to add some fruity characteristic to the beer. This most orange tasting beer I have ever had. They must have added a lot of orange zest to the beer.\\t\\tThe carbonation is medium low in this beer. It has a smooth carbonation to it.\\t\\tThe drinkability is pretty good for the how high it is in alcohol. The beer has a smooth flavor so it is quite easy to drink. \\t\\tOverall, a distinctive creative ale that has some minor flaws but overall is a nice tasting beer.

It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing.\\t\\tThe nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it.\\t\\tThe flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced.\\t\\tGiven the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8%\\t\\tThis beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here. There's a template in there to work from. But if I was Caldera I would go back to the drawing board on this one.\",\n",

Down right black body with just the faintest of brown glows at the edges when held to bright light. \\t\\tS- big bold dark roasted malts and a deep molasses sweetness. There some anise and coffee going on that reminds me of new orleans chicory coffee. \\t\\tT- yup that a big ole stout. Opens up with a powerful punch of super dark roasted malts that give you a lot of dark bakers chocolate, coffee, blackstrap molasses and dark breads. The roast and sweet are well balanced and a solid earthy hopping blend smoothly in with the rest. Finish is long and roasty but not heavy or overbearing in any way. \\t\\tM- full bodied with a bit of chew to it but not sticky or cloying and the carb while staring out light builds just enough to clear the palate and get you going back for more quickly. Touches of heat but its a welcomed heat. \\t\\tO- this is a great ris and one that is cruzing well under the radar. Better then a lot of those hyped up beasties and super easy to enjoy. I'd like to get a few of these and lay them down for a bit.\",\n",

Exactly how a beer called \"Old Growth\" should smell. \\t\\tBold. This is a big bold beer and yet is incredibly balanced.

Sure, there was a bitter backbone on the finish, but only as much as necessary to keep it balanced.

I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well.\\tTerrific and recommended if you can get it.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Pour: Light copper color with hints of red. Two and a half fingers of off-white head that sticks around for awhile and laces the glass nicely. \\t\\tSmell: Strong grapefruit aroma up front. Underlying tones of pine, caramel, and slightly fruity. \\t\\tTaste: Citrus and piney hops make their presence known up front, followed by a rich caramel malty character that's slightly biscuity. Some hints of tropical fruit also come through, and finishes with a huge tart grapefruit bitterness. Beautifully balanced flavor. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium body and oily. Coats the mouth with hop oils. Pretty high carbonation. Dry finish. \\t\\tDrinkability: Very smooth drinking IPA. Refreshing and delicious.\\t\\tFinal Notes: A delicious IPA that comes in a can. What more could you ask for? Has enough flavor for pairing against a spicy meal, but refreshing enough for tailgating, fishing/camping trips, days at the country club, and the like. A good all-around beer.\",\n",

Taste- I got more pine and heavy hop scent on the nose than I do on the first taste, but it is backed by a nice and mellow malt background. This is not a hop monster, but is very mellow and pleasant. Mouthfeel: syrupy, luscious, nice carbonation. Drinkability: this IPA is very drinkable- very mellow, and overall impressive.',\n",

It has that grapefruit sourness; a nice blend of hops and subtle malts. Slight carbonation and a very easy mouthfeel for this IPA, not heavy at all. This brew should be a top contender in the IPA market if it is not already and it is one of my favorites ever since it was recommended to me. Shout outs to Whole Foods Plymouth Meeting.\",\n",

Smell is strong; piney hops w/ citric notes and touch of spice and a sturdy malt base of caramel and some roasted malt as well. Smooth medium body, borderline creamy, with a great citric hop bite and minor sharp carbonation for a cutting beer. Balanced with minor sweet caramel and some roasted/toasted/dry malt feel so you get that pleasure of both citric notes (w/ a touch of pepper or coriander taste) and some sticky sweetness. A real dry, hearty finish lets you know you are drinking a well-balanced and made IPA and while not the greatest beer ever it is rock solid for an IPA w/ that wet, grassy, almost veg like feeling IPAs from the northwest have.

       "  'review/text': \"Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.\",\n",

Pours with a very frothy slightly off white 2 finger head that dissipates to about 1 finger and leaves a nice lacing all the way around the glass.\\t\\tSmell - The smell has some great pine and citrus qualities from the hops. A very rustic and earthy scent can be found. There are hints of grapefruit and a bit of orange rind. Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness.\\t\\tTaste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness.\\t\\tMouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated.\\t\\tDrinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans. The 6 pack may be an issue but I'd attempt it. \\t\\tGreat IPA, in a can no less.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Now available in NC, and now I can see it and smell it the score went up. A really great canned IPA for the pool /beach or really anywhere. I also like Avery IPA, and Modus in cans, but I would have to give this brew a leg up on either, a little more fruit and hops than the others and at 6.1 ABV really drinkable. Not terribly bitter either, so it would makea great IPA for anyone who wants to step up ftom PA's to IPA's.\\t\\tAlso found the last sixer in Myrtle Beach on the shelf, and what a great surprise. Not only the only the only canned IPA available but a damn tasty one, Drank it out of the can so I have no idea on what it looked like, smelled like or any kinda head retention, but I loved it. I also had some Modus, but Caldera was definitely a little more fruity. IMO a real find, and a real solid A kinda brew. Would have scored higher if not being guzzled at the beach which knocked down the appearance and nose, Drink ability is good but the ABV in the killer heat had to be respected although not a heavyweight in this dept\",\n",

I pick up grapefruit, flowers, a touch of herbs and grass and a bit of musk smell that I associate with Columbus hops, a nice fresh hop aroma. The malt has a very noticeable toasted/biscuit note, much more up front than many IPAs.\\t\\tTaste is quite smooth overall, the biscuity malt balances nicely with the hop bitterness. It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor. The finish is remnants of biscuity malts and some hop bitterness and citrus. Overall, even a minute after I take a sip, the toasty malt is the dominant flavor on the finish. Quite nice.\\t\\tMouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation.\\t\\tOverall I very much enjoyed this beer, a big IPA with a strong malt base yet substantial hop flavor.

       "  'review/text': 'This beer pours a very lovely copper amber color with a fluffy, sticky, slightly off-white head. The aroma is typical American IPA with plenty of grapefruit, orange, pine and caramel malt aroma. The taste is hop forward yet pretty well balanced with tons of hop flavor and bitterness, but a decent malt backbone to hold it up. Flavors are similar to the nose with grapefruit, orange, pine forest and caramel malt sweetness with a bit of toastyness as well. Medium bodied with a great finish that is not too sticky or dry and lingers just long enough. Very drinkable and a great, sessionable IPA.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Specs: Simcoe, Centennial, and Amarillo hops, with 94 IBUs...definitely looking forward to this\\t\\tA: Pours a semi-transparent amber/copper color. The eggshell head is real fluffy and big. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick sheet of foam on top throughout the duration of the drink.\\t\\tS: Very pungent nose; tropical fruits like pineapple and slight mango, piny resinous hops, and slight earthy undertones. Citrus (grapefruit and slight orange and lemon peel) is also apparent. Alcohol peeks through the nose a little bit, but doesn't take away from anything. Malts give a firm base and seem like they will balance nicely.\\t\\tT: A little different from the nose...the 94 IBUs really shine and give off a puckering bitterness. Earthy, resinous, and citric hops make up a majority of the flavor. I don't know exactly what gives this flavor off (I have the same thing in my dry hopped IPA that was brewed a few weeks ago) but it tastes like the smell of whole hop flowers- slightly vegetal...I did dry hop with Simcoe so maybe thats where it comes from. Malts lend a caramel and toffee backing that helps to balance, but seems to be consumed by the hop bombardment. \\t\\tMF/D: Smooth and creamy feel. Pretty big body for the style. Carbonation is awesome- at the ideal level in my book. Not necessarily a complete palate killer, but close to it. This makes for a good outdoor occasion IPA.\\t\\tNotes: Solid IPA. Typical of the west coast style- bitter and resinous. Great tailgate or beach beer\",\n",

New to my blighted and \"Famously Hot\" city of Columbia - the heart of Darkness of South Carolina - Caldera IPA is a welcome reminder that I once lived, nay, was even born in the Pacific Northwest.... and someday may be blessed to return.\\t\\tThe Caldera can itself is a rather ugly yellow with lots of hop cones around a, uh, caldera (cauldron) and the whole thing is rather an affront to the eyes, perhaps designed by a 2nd year art student who dropped out to smoke dope and lie on the beach with his rotund black lab and pierced girlfriend, but what do I know.\\t\\tCaldera IPA is a dull, clear deep yellow, with a nice head that never really dies and some nice sticky lace. Smells good, but not great - pungent and resiny West-Coast-Yo hops, malt is regulated to the background. Grapefruit and some citrusy fruit, a smack of booze. Taste is similar, more hop-bitter forward, a bit thin, sweet but not terribly characterful malt. No real surprises here, but it\\'s not bad. A fine finish, adequate carbonation and some finishing hop bitterness turn this into a pretty solid IPA.\\t\\tCaldera can\\'t quite hang with the big dogs, and at a price of $12 a six pack has to do a little more to justify itself in my mind. This is a good IPA, but the world is rife with good IPAs... I would gladly drink this anytime, but if my distributor is reading this, man, have you seen what $12 buys you on the streets of Ashland these days?',\n",

Great head retention which hangs around for a good 10 minutes. There are two fairly prominent floaties in here; not sure if they're hops, or pieces of Oregon.\\t\\tS  The aroma is a little subdued, but what I'm getting out of it, I like. Lots of really earthy pinecones and trees, orange marmalade, light grass and a fair amount of caramel dipped bread.\\t\\tT  I don't see a date on the can, but I think this might be on the older side. BUT, being just over the hill doesn't stop this from being delicious. The hop profile is on the mild side, but maintains for the entire taste with fresh cut grass, lemon soda, barely bitter grapefruit and spruce. The malt that backs all of that up comes out in toasted nuts, lightly sweet caramel, hearty rye bread. There is a really nice balance going on here  while I would like the hops to stand up a little more, the malt profile is still second fiddle. But even though the malt characteristics take a backseat to the hops, the nut+caramel bread combo is fantastic.\\t\\tM  No problems here  medium bodied, a touch on the syrupy side with an understated carbonation pop.\\t\\tO  Easily a beer I could drink by the six pack. Also would be good for a newer ipa drinker who need some malt balance and isn't bitter to the point of no return.\",\n",

Got this one thanks to my first trade with womencantsail.\\t\\tA: The pour into my oversized snifter rises a fluffy head of over 1 finger. It's a semi clear slightly darker amber reddish almost flourescent color.\\t\\tN: Lots of fresh hops. Loaded with pine and citrus, just as a west coast IPA should be. Little bit of chewy and earthy hops, and hints of musty fresh wet hops and hop oils. A very light sweet malt aroma dusts it as well.\\t\\tT: A big bitter bite. Lots of earthy musty spicy hops with some hop oil and fresh wet hop flavors. Some pine and grapefruit, a little more citrus, and chewy hops. Pretty bitter, or more than I expected. A slight sweet malt touch just for a little roundedness. \\t\\tM: Some spicy hops and some oils, a good body and good carbonation.\\t\\tF: The bitterness builds a little on the finish, and just ramps up to a nice peak and lingers there for a bit. The musty fresh wet hop flavors, pale hops, and earthy hop flavors seem to linger for a while, with a touch of pine. A little orange peel bitterness hits as well. A nice IPA, some good hop flavors, but a little too musty and bitter, orange peel bitterness.\",\n",

Pour is from the can to a pint glass.\\t\\tAppearance: Pours a pretty vibrant copper color and starts with about a 1 finger of slightly off-white head that fades to a pretty full and thick skim; body is clear and shows strong carbonation; a prety full curtain of lacing holds tight to the sides of the glass.\\t\\tSmell: A lot of nice and bitter hops like a good IPA should have - tons of pine and bitter citric fruit peel. Straightforward, no questions to be asked.\\t\\tTaste: I'm impressed - Caldera's Pale Ale was a real let down, but this is quite solid; lots of bitter hops right up front -- very piney and that citric fruit peel that is oh so nice and bitter and not juicy at all (not that juicy is bad either, but this one is straight up bitter); faint malt presence offers a little bit of sweetened balance, but the bitter dominates; fairly strong metallic aftertaste, but it's still really good and doesn't downplay the solid flavors too much.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Strong carbonation makes it feel very crisp and lively; body isn't thin, but not quite thick either -- about where I would like an IPA; a nice stickiness from all that hop resin coats the roof of the mouth quite nicely. \\t\\tDrinkability: Actually, I could probably drink this all day; nice solid bitter flavor with a crisp and refreshing body; would be great for a hot summer day, but I can't complain about drinking it when it's 15 degrees outside either...\",\n",

To be fair, it has a remarkable balance to it...i really enjoy this beer, and for something in a \"can\", which most people are shaky about, i found it impressive.\\t\\tM- Medium body, nice mixed malty/bitter after finish that is slightly cloying but not offensively. \\t\\tD- This stuff is fun to drink. The can is yellow, lively, and fun to look at. I see people looking at this beer all day on the shelf wondering why something in 6 pack cans costs so much. I have an answer for them now! GREAT BEER!',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Didn't really think much of other Caldera brews I've had, but heard good things about this one and thought it would be worth a try. \\t\\tPours a nice, slightly hazy, toasted ruby-brown color. There's visible carbonation running throughout, feeding a short, well-retained white head. There's a tremendous amount of sticky white lace that marbles the sides of the glass without any signs of fading. \\t\\tSmell is all hops - aromas of grapefruit rind and earthy, musky hops come through. There's only the slightest indication of sweetness from the malts. \\t\\tTaste definitely reflects the largely hop-forwardness of the aroma. The bitter citrus rind presence in most detectable in the aftertaste, and a hint of the piney, oily sticky hops hits the tongue early on. There is more of a malt foundation in the taste, but it is hardly sweet - more toasty, full and warm. The aftertaste is really nice; it makes me want to wait between sips to enjoy it a little more. Feel is bright and perfectly carbonated - not too much and not too little. It fills the mouth and spreads the flavors around the palate very well.\\t\\tThis is one highly drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink it from the can because you don't see that all that often with crafts. I went for the glass, and enjoyed every last drop. Definitely recommended for a try. It is a solid, everyday IPA.\",\n",

I already drank one of my three this morning before even writing anything down. My notes for Ashland Amber included commentary on the CAN itself, including verbiage and mention of CAN-conditioning. This, however, was a visually appealing CAN with vibrant color reproduction and a green pop-tab. My buds at that stoner joint, Roots (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10996/?view=beerfly), would fully dig this CAN. Hey, before anybody gets their panties in a bunch, a) I kid and b) I CAN pass a urinalysis standing on my head. I dig beer, you dig? Plus, that place has a really smoky vibe and I am sure that they would not be particularly offended. Onward.\\t\\tBoth times, my pour has begun with a finger of ecru head which has simply sat down, leaving sticky Belgian lacing in its wake. The nose is forest hops - pine, green, earthy, sticky, massive. Sweet hops the hope of my life - once again, that damned howling monkey shut up and climbed off of my back for the moment. I am on the waiting list for hops rehab but it's a long list and I may not last that long. Thank Bob for hops! \\t\\tIt now becomes a simple matter of drawing some of this delectable beverage into a syringe through a needle and jamming said needle into one of the few remaining viable veins. No heating necessary. Cold fusion is more satisfactory, anyway. Once I untie my rubber hose, the euphoric quality begins to set in. I am one with the Beeriverse. My existance is justified. I'm not just a simple Hophead. I am a HopJunkie and an unapologetic one, at that. My licking the lacing out of the glass is starting to draw stares from the nieghbors. So what?!? The heck with them! This is my scene, man, and don't mess with me while I'm digging it. Find your own scene and report back. \\t\\tMan, how do I convey veinfeel over mouthfeel? It was righteous! Full, sticky, veinous (not vinous), right on, baby! Finish was hoppy, sticky, yummy, the EMTs are trying to restart my heart, man. Zounds!\\t\\tWhere am I? Was this a review? Wow, man. What a groovy trip. Did you dig the scene too, or was it just me? I gotta get in the shower, man. I'll try anything once.\",\n",

My first craft beer from a can.\\t\\tA-Clear amber-orange with 1 1/2 finger, off-white head with average retention and moderate lacing. Very pleasing appearance.\\t\\tS-Piney hops with some citrus aroma present. Very inviting.\\t\\tT-Somewhat disappointing since the flavor does not match well with expected smell and is dominated by earthy bitterness that is ultimately unbalanced. I couldn't discern any malt backbone. Very bitter, persistent after taste. Not very pleasant. Unsure about freshness, but this has not been a concern from the seller/distributors. I like hoppy IPAs, but prefer balance too. Balance was absent.\\t\\tM-Begins well but ends up being harsh because of the after taste. Low to medium carbonation gives is it a smoothness that is unfortunately emasculated by the bitterness. \\t\\tD-An average West Coast IPA. Okay, but I won't buy again. The bitter aftertaste nearly gave me heartburn.\\t\\tIf offered one to drink I would drink it but only after concluding nothing better is available. A bit pricey compared to better Oregon brewed IPAs. I bought this today because I wanted to try some different IPAs on hot day in the Willamette Valley. Overall, I was nonplussed.\",\n",

A nice rocky head forms off the pour and a thin layer clings to the glass and hangs around all the way down.\\tS - Nice hoppy nose off this one, with some maltiness mixed in.\\tT - Funny how your brain needs to adjust when drinking out of a can; first sip of this was during a round of golf, right out of the can and my first thought was, \"wow, this is GOOD beer\" because you\\'re expecting something thin and watered down. A \"proper\" tasting confirms my first sip; poured into a glass, this is a damn good, drinkable IPA. Nice hint of sweetness up front which is quickly run over by a nice rindy, bittery-y flavor which hangs around on the tongue for quite a while between sips. \\tM - This drinks pretty smooth; carbonation is pretty low but the bitterness hangs around for a while (in a good way). \\tDamn solid IPA; highly recommend grabbing it if you spot it somewhere (especially you East Coasters).',\n",

Including Caldera IPA. Not only never heard of the brew, no clue the brewery even existed. \\t\\tThe pour is the initial use of a Flying Fish glass that marcpal sent me recently. Clearly he read my mind about the need for smaller glasses in the house. Thanks Marc!\\t\\tThe 12 oz. goes into the tulip with about an ounce or so to spare. The smell knocks me for a loop, a bitter, disgusted, angry, fucked-up hophead's dream searing my nostrils. I was kind of looking at this as a nice, gentle way to start off the night. What did I get myself into? \\t\\tAh, I see. I got myself into a kick-ass IPA I've never heard of before. The taste is aggressively hopped, pleasantly oily, bitter, sharp, clean, & all the things a good IPA claims to be. Wow. First-class IPA. Really, really good. \\t\\tI could drink these all night. \\t\\tThanks Mr. Hophead, I am going to put this on my wants list hoping people will drop a can or two in as extras. The only thing preventing me from trading for it is the existence of a local brew, Surly Furious, maybe you've heard of it. This is...almost...no. I can't even type it. It's close. Great beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12 oz. can poured into a nonic, the Caldera's IPA is a clear bronze with a moderate sized white head that quickly fades to a thick skim, leaving scattered lace. Like their Pale Ale I just reviewed, this is the first time I've ever not had this beer in a can, but I'm not nearly as impressed. Served at fridge temp.\\t\\tSmell is pure, resiny cannabis - ah, Oregon! To be more specific, it's more of the cat piss style, which you probably won't care for unless you have the mental association. I was just working on my goggle tan at Mt. Ashland this past Wednesday, and by the number of heads goofing off with me on a work day, it's obvious this town operates on a slightly slower speed. With a smell like this, I think Caldera's trying to remind us there's always time to chill...\\t\\tTaste is pungent, resiny hops, firm malt backbone with a big bitter finish. The slightest touch of sweet caramel malt loses the battle to the big buds, which pack enough lupin to knock out Bobby Brown on a 3 day coke binge. \\t\\tMouthfeel is creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. \\t\\tDrinkability is average. I like a lot more hop flavor then bitterness, and this IPA is pretty much the opposite, and a bit thick for my taste as well. I'll still give it bonus points for the can, not to mention that dank aroma that I never noticed from the can.\",\n",

What caramel malt there is is folded into a neat envelope of juicy hops.\\t\\tT: Pithy bitterness sprays from this IPA from the first taste. There is very little malt getting through here; this is an fairly unbalanced hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit bitterness and pine resin - very little caramel malt or other sweetness getting through. \\t\\tM: Medium mouthfeel, but with a long-lasting hoppy cling. This has orange, grapefruit and pine nesting on the center and back of the tongue.

Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.',\n",

Some lightly tropical, but mostly generic bitterness is largely overshadowed by the heavy caramel malt presence (though not a big sweetness - this beer is pretty dry). Seems somewhat out of balance. Mouthfeel is strong in carbonation and a medium body with some malty stickiness. Overall, this is a very drinkable, very (caramel) malt forward IPA with a mild tropical/generic bitterness.

Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation.

Thanks to BA redbird.\\t\\tThis brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I got a nice head on the pour but the coloring is a much lighter and watery looking amber color than that is expected of most IPA's. The smell is pretty nice. Mostly sweet pineapple but the hops aren't that noticeable. Very sugary as well. But I do have to give it points for being pretty strong in the nose even if it isn't showing bitterness. The bitterness is fairly sharp in the front but it fades into a kind of cheapish sweet corn and cereal like lager. Aftertaste also leaves a lot to be desired. Actually after the initial bitterness there really isn't much other flavor besides the corn and more bitterness. Pretty one dimensional. A bit too overcarbonated and kind of leaves a bad feel in your mouth. Well it is easy drinking. I can give it that. Heard a lot of good things about this beer. It failed to impress me. No canned/best by date so who knows how fresh it is. At $12 a six pack this beer is total fail! I didn't even see the price til it rang up and I thought it was a mistake and had to look at the screen to make sure. Even if it was pretty good that price is pretty bad.\",\n",

Preface, I can recall many a pleasant afternoons spent in SE Portland drinking this at Otto's accompanied by a smoked sausage. \\t\\tA- Golden amber color with a whitish head. Not sure if I dropped the can before pouring, but the head was two and half fingers when poured moderately. Reduces to a firm thorough covering the lasts. Plenty of lacing on the glass. No visible carbonation bubbles.\\t\\tS- Hops! Complex mixture of grapefruit, grassy, and herbal tones. Not much malt. Very very hop forward. \\t\\tT- Wish it tasted like it smelled minus the grassy aroma. Bitter at the front and end. I taste white onion throughout. It is quite the hop wallop, but the onion seems to be the main taste (had nothing to eat before tasting, so no lingering food tastes). Minus the onion, I think this would be dead on.\\t\\tM- Medium body with minimal carbonation. Dry finish on the tongue. Lingers bitter with that onion taste.\\t\\tD- Still would drink it for nostalgia reasons alone, but it holds up. Perfect for mowing the lawn or a softball game. It is easy to drink.\",\n",

Pretty sure I\\'ve had this before...\\t\\tHere\\'s the description from Caldera\\'s website for this year-round offering:\\t\"A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon; Original gravity: 1.052; Alcohol by volume: 5.4%.\"\\t\\tA: Beautiful, slightly hazy honey-orange color. Light to moderate fast-rising carbonation. Topped with a creamy, off-white head, about 1-1/2 fingers, gently fading. Good lace.\\t\\tS: Malty caramel, a touch sweet. A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. \\t\\tT: More toffee-maltiness than I\\'d expected, but offset with that \\'orange\\' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall.\\t\\tM: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue. This analogy may sound weird, but it felt like a quarter was being pressed down on my tongue...\\t\\tD: For a beer without a definitive style to grade against, I can really just say that - yes - it was enjoyable and - yes - I would get it again.',\n",

Not bad, but more restrained then I expected.\\t\\tThe taste is bitter sweet, a little grainy, not much hops and a touch of passionfruit. Basically drinks like a pale ale, not as fruity or tart as I was expecting. While I didn\\'t want a daiquiri, I could have used more of the \"real passion fruit puree\" that this was made with. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel was quite nice, creamy and very light without being watery. \\t\\tThis was pretty drinkable, mainly due to the light body and borderline bland taste. I, however, like my beers have to some punch to them taste wise, and didn\\'t find that here.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"From bomber to pint glass 08/10/10\\t\\tA: Pours a deep orange-copper with a 1 inch, mocha-colored head. Appears quite oily and dense for the style and the carbonation looks like it's struggling to escape. Lots of foamy lacing.\\t\\tS: Citrusy grapefruit aroma and lots of pine. There is a faint sweetness in the backdrop, but the overall nose seems a little dampened.\\t\\tT: Bitter, grapefruity hops crash the palate, balanced by a touch of bready, slightly sweet malts. The hops are powerful here but they work well against the honey sweetness. There's some orange and lemon zest in there, and the alcohol has a warming effect halfway through each sip. As the beer warms, grassy, earthy, almost floral flavors can be detected. The beer finishes pleasantly bitter and dry.\\t\\tM: This is a fairly rich, chewy beer and could pass for a DIPA in its texture. The carbonation is perfect for this style and nicely washes away each sip. The taste is much more vibrant than the nose, and I wonder if that's due in part to its oily, full-bodied composition.\\t\\tD: This is a total hop-bomb, but as your palate adjusts to the aggressively bitter hop profile you'll find this brew quite balanced. I noticed myself drinking faster as I was writing this review.\\t\\tNotes: Overall, quite impressive. This could easily pass for a California IPA and could stand up against some of the better known hop monsters coming out of SoCal. I'm really particular about IPA's and fairly skeptical about unknown renditions, but after finishing a pint I'm surprising satisfied.This is the first offering I've sampled from Caldera and they've passed my IPA test with flying colors, so they'll be on my radar.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This beer pours a wonderful copper amber with only a slight white head and decent lacing. The aroma is very complex with plenty of pine and citrus hops, but also some toasty roasty malt character that is not overpowering and quite nice. The flavor follows the same path. Very bitter with a huge citrus and pine punch to the taste buds, as well as a groin kick of roasted and caramel malt. I have to say, I thought this was just a normal IPA, but it seems to be leaning a bit more towards an American strong ale/Black IPA in flavor. Astringency and bitterness fight a battle royal in my mouth, and I am lucky enough to have a front row seat. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and has one of those sticky/dry finishes that are common in beers of this gravity and hop load. Not the most drinkable for style, but still goes down pretty easily. I really like this, and am glad it comes in a bomber.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Had this on tap at Horse Brass. It arrived at the same time as my wife\\'s Guinness and our friend\\'s Black Butte. The similarity in the beers visibly was uncanny. It was a solid opaque black graced with a regal quaff of foam.\\t\\tThe aroma was tart and slightly smokey. Mild, but partly due to the competition with the fancy pipe smoke from the guy sitting next to us.\\t\\tThe taste was astounding. Its rare that you stumble across something that can easily replace a standard with such ease. Nothing in this beer is overstated, but the smooth combination of dry, tart and peat, with a slight fruitiness in just the right amount for a sweet compliment.\\t\\tThis is a stellar seasonal, and I hope they keep the recipe. I would not change a single thing. There seems to be confusion over what this beer is. Caldera\\'s \"site\" says that it changes by season. This years seems to be somewhere between a tart stout and a old brown.',\n",

Amber is finally in a can! \\t\\tpours a rich, orange tinged textbook amber hue, crystal clear with a thick, light tannish-orange two-finger head that has impressive retention and leaves behind just a bit of lacing. more lacing and this one would be perfect. \\t\\taroma is a fairly potent yet straight forward mix of malts, a hint of caramel, and green, herbal, and pine hop notes. Simple, yet effective. \\t\\tTaste follows suit in its simplicity and effectiveness. Clean, with a decent malt backbone gives it a hint of caramel sweetness, flanked by some fairly hoppy notes. hints of vegetable and green herbal notes are present along with a bit of black tea. A good bitter kick from the galena hops in the finish.\\t\\tMouthfeel is clean, well carbonated, medium body, and all around a solid example of an amber. nothing outstanding, but can\\'t find any fault. \\t\\tAll in all, I\\'m stoked to see Caldera Amber in a can, which definitely helps the drinkability score. on their website, they say \"Simplicity is the key to this recipe.\" Sounds about right. nothing earth-shattering, but definitely a solid amber that I could drink a few of in a row. Enough hop and malt character to push it past most generic ambers, this one is a definite winner in my book.',\n",

The middle is nutty and the beer finishes up semi-sweet and with quite a punch of piney hops.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Light with a fair amount of carbonation, but not overly done. Crisp and clean. \\t\\tDrinkability: Easily drinkable and very sessionable.

Brilliant balance. \\t\\tAshland Amber opens with a malty bang. Hard on comes an assortment of fall nuts, sans salt, & do they have staying power. The acorns cling tenaciously to the palate. I'll not be surprised if squirrels claw their way through the siding, drywall, & fridge door to get into these cans. Light hopping, eyeful of bitter, pepper. Perhaps one of the thickest, chewiest ambers I've had, this could easily pass into brown, or almost porter, territory. That, combined with the tastiness & lovely perfume, make this difficult to sip. \\t\\tExcellent beer, one of the better ambers I've tasted in quite a while. Another winner.

       "  'review/text': \"Pour - fills this glass with an amazingly colorful auburn liquid with some flashes of ruby red and bright orange with a big thick batter-like off-white head on top. \\t\\tAroma - bread dough, caramel, apple butter, raw sugar, cocoa and some slight citrus. Smells great. I can't wait to move on to the best part of all of this.\\t\\tTaste - big malty, biscuity, bready sweetness hits the palate immediately. This may be a simple recipe but it sure has been perfected. This has the perfect balance of maltiness and some citrus hops to balance things out. The malt profile is something I am really enjoying, I'm not sure how best to describe it. I'd have to say its somewhere between honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts. Well, maybe not that sweet but it is surely delicious. \\t\\tOverall - great amber ale, one that I could definitely enjoy in multiple amounts. I love the flavor that this imparts and the great balance that it has with the PNW hops used. Amber Ales may not be my favorite style but this is proof that I could love any beer if its brewed well. \\t\\tWould I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I had access to Caldera out here but its also nice to know that its a regional brewery and I'll be sure to stop in to the brewpub if I am ever in Ashland again.\",\n",

A small quick dissolving head is present. Aroma is quite sweet with lots of caramel, breads, yeast, and malts. Some fruits come through with warming. Quaff is slightly watery but some malts and toffee. Pretty smooth drinking brew for the mediocre ABV. Mouthfeel is crisp and thin. Drinkability is good. I would like to know the freshness of this brew but it is definitely enjoyable on a summer day. Very sessionable.',\n",

       "  'review/text': '12 oz. can poured into a trusty pint glass. Pour nets an inch of cream or light tan head crowning a crystal clear medium amber body. Decent retention and lace. The aroma hits the nostrils with the same blend of hops that is familiar to me from their pale ales, lots of resiny pine character. Second to that is a lightly nutty caramel malt element. Taste has a mild sweetness which turns into a crisp resinous hoppiness. Caramel or nougaty malt balance pops up in the midpalate as well, but the finish splits nicely between malt and full on hops. High level of hops for an amber, actually very close to the pales, but I like this better with the malt balance. Medium thick body with a creamy medium carbonation. Recommended, my favorite Caldera of the three cans I have tried.',\n",

Now, for those may be arriving late to today\\'s program, already well in progress, I not only review the beers, but I also transcribe the verbiage so that you do not have to. \\t\\tI thought that Ska was very clever: It\\'s [Modus Hoperandi] label read: \"Walk, Kite, Recycle, Hide, Seek, Plant, Recycle, Grow, Shower, HHH, Tube, Recycle.\" \\t\\tBut now, from this one\\'s exterior: \" \\'Live Product. Keep Cool. Just Like You.\" Yeah, man. How many times have my students heard me say, \"Be cool, baby. Be real cool.\"? Innumerable. A ring around the neck read \"Go Biking ... Go Rafting ... Go CANS! ... Go Skiing ... Go Fishing ... Go Snowboarding ... www.calderabrewing.com\". \\t\\tIt reminds me of the joke of the financially strapped male children looking for something to do on a hot summer\\'s day. They pool their limited resources and send one of their number to the local grocer\\'s, only to have him return with a box of tampons. Incredulous at this purchase, one of them inquires as to his choice. His response: \"Well, the box reads, \\'With this product, you can go swimming, camping, fishing and a whole host of fun activites\\'.\" Har!\\t\\tYeah, me, I\\'m going to skip all of that fun stuff with the exception of \"Go CANS!\" Here we go, CANS, here we go!\\t\\tA friend of mine in the industry remarked that he feels that the days of generic \"Amber\" beers have passed. I disgree, but let\\'s see how this stacks up.\\t\\tThe finger-and-a-half of head was light-tan with good retention. Remember that \"Live Product\" jazz? Well, it had a slight haze to its deep-amber color suggestive of the presence of yeast. CAN-conditioned?!? Holy Drop the Corks and Cages, Batman! Gee, the nose smelled nothing like an amber of yore. Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow! How many more CANs of this do I have left? Somebody said that they have distribution in MD ... Bye!',\n",

Poured from the can into a pint glass...\\t\\tAppearance: For an amber, the color seems off as it is just a pretty plain coppery color with a nice, clear body -- I guess I would expect at least some ruby-esque highlights in there, if not a strong amber body...; light carbonation; one finger slightly off-white head that fades to a nice thick skim and very sparse lacing that's very thin.\\t\\tSmell: Mild, rassy smelling hoppy aroma with some lightly toasted malts; something seems amiss in the nose though and it's got a bit of rotted vegetative scent that reminds me of cabbage. Not a good start, but there have been other times where I've smelled something similar in ambers and haven't been let down by the flavor so I'm optimistic.\\t\\tTaste: Mostly getting the toasty malts and some of the mildly bitter hop presence, but not much else overall it's very mild... Not bad, but I have definitely had much more flavorful ambers that rate much higher than this.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Body is thin and water and a little flat; finsih is wet and is like drinking malt flavored water. \\t\\tDrinkability: Overall, it's not hard to drink, but there's not much reason to do so. The flavors are mild and meek, the body is super watery and doesn't offer much, so I don't feel I will be drinking this again.\",\n",

Dark cocoa, semi sweet, creamy, with some brown sugar, espresso, and hints of oak. Finish is crisp, with really subtle booziness.\\t\\tMouthfeel is nice, full, smooth, and lightly carbonated.\\t\\tOverall this is outstanding. This is an excellent beer that you can really taste the dark chocolate, but it still retains the flavors of a robust porter too. The balance is nice, very well done Caldera. Even my wife liked this, and she is not a fan of dark beers.\",\n",

According to the beer label, this \"dry, refreshing honeyed ale\" is brewed with Welsh honey from the New Quay Honey Farm. The brewery website also lists down numerous awards won by this beer: \\t* Gold award for best golden ale at South Devon CAMRA beer festival 2007. \\t* Double Silver Medal winner at SIBA West & Mold beer festivals 2006. \\t* Double silver medal at The Great Welsh Beer & Cider festival 2007 & 2008.\\t\\tA: pours a bright tawny hue with mixture of fine and huge bubbles in action, topped with a lingering white fluffy head.\\tS: upon the opening, a whiff of skunky note escapes from the bottle, albeit not pungent; in the glass, the aroma has resinous notes of hops, sweet/syrupy orangey citrusness, and intensity of nectar (due to the honey?) all coming before a lighter performance of biscuity malts... a swirl gives rise to a rather focused and clean flow of spicy-floral touch of English hops on top of the settled citrusness (a bit like Challenger to me).\\tT: the taste is yeasty, earthy and slightly grassy from the start (in a pleasant way), carrying with it a \"settled\" pale ale maltiness (with hints of raw-ish grains) and lightly sour-sweet citric+honey flavour; gradually, the latter two elements (sort of) intertwine to result in a clean palate of lingeringly aromatic honey-malty aftertaste, leaving ample space for the moderate-level hop bitterness with its tangy-citric edge to develop quietly at the back of the palate.\\tM&D: not bad in terms of bottle-conditioning, as shown by the refreshing (but not sharp) carbonation and a sound body that stays intact throughout the drink; somehow the honey is perhaps (too) well-consumed and leaves little trace in the beer, as compared with malts and citric hops, dragging down the performance a bit if one looks to have adequate honey pleasure of any form in his glass (like me). That said, this is a well-made, dry-ish quaffable golden bitter all the same.',\n",

Anyway, it opens with a thick head of one-inch atop a pitch black body. Upon the initial sip - smooth and pleasant, there was retained very thick lacing with heavy clingage.\\t\\tThe nose detected subtle molasses notes though not an overwhelming sense. The palate gets a toasty malt bite with aftertaste. Like I said, it was smooth. Enjoyable quaff of a wonderfully balanced stout, although I would not handle more than two of these. \\t\\tGood job on the Killer Whale.',\n",

In the Netherlands, it is often not allowed to drink \"normal\" pilsner beers before and during a football match (because of the alcohol). So instead of alcohol-free beer, the stadium management decided to serve low-alcohol beer. Seems a fair choice, and, on top of that, this low-calorie beer also suits any diet ;) \\t\\tPoured into a plastic beaker. The beer poured a typical yellow-straw pilsner color, with a big fluffy head. \\t\\tSmell: almost not there, some malts. That\\'s it.\\t\\tTaste: Like a normal pilsner, only weaker. Malts and hops, with some strange, dusty taste in the middle that I cannot really describe (some type of grain maybe).\\t\\tMouthfeel: thin and watery. Medium carbonation\\t\\tOverall: Well, what to say. Not a great pilsner, as my fellow BA-members also indicate in the rating. However, I think that most people here seem to forget, that this beer has almost NO calories. Given that fact, I think the brewers did a great job, still being able to put so much taste in. But in general, if you don\\'t have any overweight and not on a diet, avoid!',\n",

At least I got to see The Roots for the 38th time.\\t\\tA- Amstel Light lives up to its name having a very light pale yellow body that looked thinner than me at the time. A thin white cap stood on top for a few but it had no legs, hence no lacing.\\t\\tS- Amstel does not smell like much and whats there is not inviting. Old grain with a light toast to it. A very light malt addition and even less when it comes to hops and a bit of corn in the back. When it warmed this smelled downright skunky.\\t\\tT- The smell on this pretty much sums up the taste as well. Grain, malt, and just a touch of bitterness on the end. Some yeast comes out but does not enhance the flavor. A taste of corn has me thinking this is a glorified american macro, even though im being very generous with the word glorified.\\t\\tM- Thin, light and watery with a big blast of carbonation. Swishing this in the mouth really brings out the grain bill. They were not lying when they said this was a light lager.\\t\\tD- The ABV on this was actually 1.5% less than what I thought it would be, now I see why people can drink the hell out of this at a bar or similiar setting, but I ask myself why, this stuff taste like impending doom. Amstel light is good enough if your trying to pass the time at a party that you dont want to be at in the 1st place, so it's got that going for it, but nothing else.\",\n",

Bubbles constantly rise to the top throughout the entire drink.\\t\\tS: Sweet malts, corn, grains, metal, some skunk aroma, alcohol... not much going on in the aroma. Overall sweet but not pleasant.\\t\\tT: Taste isn't much better: corn, grains and water with a sweet malt finish. Tastes like your typical European lager, though slightly more watery and less flavorful because it's a light. I have heard this is the best light beer, and I must say I am not impressed.\\t\\tM: Very smooth, watery; not as carbonated as it looks. Very light bodied. I prefer a little more body from my beers, though you can't expect much from this style of beer.\\t\\tD: Yes, it is very drinkable, very smooth and watered down, but at 3.5% alcohol you'd have to drink a lot of these just to get a buzz... but I guess that's the point. Overall, absolutely nothing spectacular here. VERY overpriced, I'm glad I got it on sale. Who would pay regular price for this?\",\n",

The nose seemed to carry over into the flavor leaving a skunky and musky grain flavor lingering about. The palate was light which only seemed to highlight the incredible brewery flaws in this beer. Overall unimpressed with the flavor and a beer that will leave you making a funny face or two on the swallow. \\t\\tM: light, with some viscosity but leaves traces of skunky plant matter behind on the tongue. Not one you want to savor or let sit to long. \\t\\tD: A big pass on this stinker.',\n",

Left over from our Memorial Day BBQ... let's give this a good, honest go.\\t\\tAppearance- Pours the lightest imaginable straw yellow... as clear as glass, this supports a two finger snow white head that crackles down to a nice, fat rim. Aside from the head's thickness, it's tinted water. No lacing to speak of.\\t\\tSmell- Immediately following my cracking the bottlecap, an acrid smell of adjuncts (corn and cereal grain) flew out of the bottle. In the glass, this combines with a cloying sweetness that struggles to add a bready malt profile. \\t\\tTaste- Sharp and pungent, the cereal notes collide with an awful mouth wrenching abomination reminiscent of stale hops and corn syrup. The finish is especially horrid.\\t\\tMouthfeel/Drinkability- Even though the initial attack is aggressive and even biting, it very quickly eases up and becomes really smooth and soft... remaining so right through the swallow. Unfortunately, this doesn't save the beer from itself. It's a hard one to drink out of a glass, purposefully noticing all of its warts. But on a blistering day, out of the cooler and down the gullet, it certainly has its place.\",\n",

The head is frothy (not enough bubbles to call soapy) but very, very frothy. The head clings tightly, coating the sides in a soapy, white residue. The colour isn\\'t quite generic - it\\'s a dusty, sandy colour. Even more unattractive than bland. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel is immensely creamy (more so then some of the CO2 induced, widget cans). The texture doesn\\'t even closely resemble that of any other style beer (except perhaps the Guinness cans). Alongside the overly creamy texture is very low carbonation - and for these reasons the beer certainly doesn\\'t quench. \\t\\tThe mouthfeel might not hinder the beer so much if it weren\\'t for the fact that it has no taste either. While the mouthfeel/texture remind me nothing of beer, the taste does little better. Any malt is difficult to pick out and placing it within a style according to its flavour would lead me to associate it only with non-alcoholic offerings. \\t\\tI\\'d had Amstel Light before and remembered it for being an equal substitute to Heineken.

This is not at all pleasant.\\t\\tM - Medium bodied for a light lager, but still quite watery. Highly carbonated with an absolutely clean finish which in this case is a blessing.\\t\\tD - Pretty nasty stuff. I haven't tried the full flavored Amstel, but I won't touch this light crap ever again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Believe it or not the comercials you see about this stuff aren\\'t lying. To date, Amstel Light (all 95 calories per 12 oz serving worth), is the best most beerlike light beer I have had. I include cheater Sam Adams Light (they stretch the definition of \"light\" with like 125 calories vs I think 150 for a regular bottle of Boston Lager) in that statement. Appearance is kind of odd because on the one hand it has a nice deep brown color, but on the other it is obviously a little watery looking, the result being that dark brown color is nearly transparent. It does manage to maintain a surprisingly stable head for a light beer. Smell is pleasant, you know hoppy, a bit of malt, a bit of yeast, basically what a normal beer is supposed to smell like. Taste is quite good. Some sweet malt, balanced presence of hops that are of decent quality, if not too exciting. A little yeast is in there too, and obviously this is a very clean tasting beer. Mouthfeel IS a bit on the watery side, but not to the point where you actually think you are drinking water whenever you take a sip without looking right at the glass. Drinkability is excellent since not only does this beer taste pretty good, but it obviously does not weight you down, plus you\\'re packing on fewer calories and not getting as drunk either. Is this going to fool you into thinking you just drank an oatmeal stout, an extra bitter, or a dopplebock? Of course not. It is still a bit on the watery side in fact. But it does a better job of hiding the fact that its a light beer than any other I\\'ve tried yet. And that slighty watery liquid at least has some real beer flavor present, if not as much richness as even I would like. Take it from me, you are not likely to find a better light beer in a regular bar. In fact, I could definately see ordering this over some regular beers that don\\'t even make me wretch when I think about drinking them (MGD, Beck\\'s, Rolling Rock, and Corona for example)',\n",

The smell is very, very faint, almost nonexistant..maybe a little grain.\\tThe taste is likewise not real strong but is pleasant in a wispy, watery kind of way. Maybe a little too much carbonation but not enough to really upset even someone who obsesses over bubbles like me. This is not a tasty, enjoyable beer but it is drinkable and good at the bar when the girls are staring at the gut.

It's smell is faint (though I admit I was rather stuffed up when I tried it), and is something like fresh spring air. \\t\\tAmstel Light starts cool, crisp, and somewhat hoppy. It is light-to-medium bodied with a bit of cane sugar flavor mixed with hop bitterness and malty wheat smoothness. This beer packs a rough, semi-dry, and tasty finish boasting lemon-, orange-, and ginger-like accents.

Nice suite, and a quick inspection of the mini fridge showed 3 choices: Bud, Bud Light, and Amstel Light. Being a good American, I started off the evening with a Bud, then before my taste buds got too anesthetized I wanted to see what the Amstel Light was like.\\t\\tTo my surprise, I rather liked it. After tasting micro beers and specialty offerings, it's important to ratchet down the expectation for a mass-produced beer. I did and was not disappointed.\\t\\tI didn't pour it out of the can, but the red and gold was attractive enough. Faint smell, nothing offensive there. The taste is very light, obviously, and kind of magnified by the carbonation. But then this hop character comes through, and I'm thinking 'not bad for a light beer!'. It's actually got a little character and personality! I decided to make a session of it and through half a dozen of these babies, I could still taste the light bitterness, enjoying the beers with metts, chicken tenders, chip and dip, chips and salsa, even a few cookies. It tasted fine with everything.\\t\\tIf I get another chance at a luxury suite, I think I'll go with Amstel Light.\",\n",

Aroma-wise? Not terrible. Water is predominant, but there's some light, sharp hoppiness and some bready malts. The taste? It starts out not too bad, it's fairly flavor deficient but has some nice subtle hop zings over some bready malt, but the finish comes in with a terrible metallic taste that basically ruins the whole thing. As it warms and my pallet becomes adjusted, this just tastes more and more like mineral water.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and prickly on the mouthfeel. The drinkability isn't great for a light beer, it tastes like it should be a bit heavier in ABV. Overall, this really isn't a great beer. It's servicable, but just barely. If it was the only thing available, I'd drink it and not complain too much. But picking this over the Yuengling and Stella in my parent's fridge was a mistake. Absolutely need a light beer? This is better than many, but seriously? Sam Adams Light or bust. It's bizarre to think that this might be better than most people's experience with this beer, because I took this bottle straight out of an unopened 12 pack.\",\n",

It's not bad but I know it shouldn't be there. \\t\\tM- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation was high but good for the beer. Light skunked flavor left on the palate and long into the aftertaste with a hint of hops and alcohol. Flavors were off balanced due to the skunked flavor. Not clean although overall it had a crisp hint to it. Light alcohol drying on the palate. \\t\\tD- This beer was average in the drinkability. It wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

Has a white head and looks alot like most other crap pilsners sold en mass in USA. Crip golden color that is appealing, but the color is a bit deceiving. Nose is grass and straw mixed with skunk. Maybe I got an old bottle but i doubt it.\\t\\tTaste is light. Not very hoppy or malty. Kind of bland. There is skunk mixed with light banana and tart acid from the high carb. Not very good. Mouth feel is watery. Overall I am unhappy with this beer.

I\\'m hoping a liquor store will prove me wrong.\\t\\tThe appearance is very bright and clean. I like the taste. They serve it up with a lime... but I tasted it without the lime squeeze and thought it tasted fantastic. I added the lime for \"flare\" and didn\\'t think it affected the overall flavor. The mouthfeel is very light and crisp. I rate this pretty high on drinkablilty because no matter what time of year, I could see myself putting a few of these back. Some people on here say it reminds them of Corona. The only thing that reminded me of Corona was the way they serve it with lime. I do not drink Corona and am not a fan of it, but this Amstel is fantastic. I\\'m not surprised that I enjoyed this because I enjoy most Amstel products.

Finishing with light sourness as well as a metallic touch.\\tM&D: the palate comes slightly too fizzy and becomes a bit watery in the end, although the body doesn\\'t fall too thin overall. This Bulgaria-brewed Amstel is a pretty bland offering, but I thank my dear flatmate for her kindest gesture all the same!',\n",

Nice lacing down the glass. Light nose with some biscuity malt and some very faint citrusy notes. Nice malts in the beginning followed by an aggressive hop bite which leads to a lingering dry finish with some faint citrus hints. Nice carbonation, not too aggressive. Light on the mouthfeel but that comes with the style I suppose. A nice and drinkable beer. Very unusual to a find Scottish klsch, but it was a nice un-Scottish way to cap off a day of decidedly un-Scottish weather (not a cloud to be seen). Quite pleasant.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This was the follow-up to BRBP\\'s \"Big Boy Beer\"... which i unfortunately did not get to taste. I did, however, sample their attempt at an Imperial IPA last year -- \"Hopsicle.\" They described this as a dry-hopped version of their \"Big Boy Beer,\" making it seem more like an IIPA. Okay, I can certainly handle that! But I immediately thought of this as an Strong Ale... having tasted their last IIPA (a PERFECT attempt, mind you), i knew that this wouldn\\'t be the same thing.\\t\\tSO, thinking of this a Strong Ale, they knocked it out of the park!\\t\\tAppearance: Obviously pulled from their cask system. Super-fine bubbled, rich lathery head... the hallmark of their english cask ales. a cloudy mahogany. Reminded me of the Tobacco Fade finish on guitars and drums. They serve this in a smaller 10-12 oz size. With an abv of 8.4, i think that is perfectly acceptable.\\t\\tSmell: I really didn\\'t pick much up! I was frustrated. Normally i expect massive amounts of hops or sweet malts or SOMETHING. The dense head just seemed to insulate the flavor bomb below. What I could smell was like flat malt beverage... \\t\\tTaste: Oh yeah. That\\'s the ticket. It was like their old Hopsicle IIPA got a dose of caramel-dipped Michigan Honeycrisp apple.\\tTo me, this was the very definition of a balanced strong ale. Everything was turned up, but still in perfect harmony.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Superfine carbonation thanks to the hand-pulled cask system. I\\'m not sure that this was the appropriate method for this brew. I\\'ve never had an English Strong Ale before, but I think I would\\'ve liked it better with the traditional american tap. I always appreciate the authenticity of their cask ales, but i\\'m not sure if it did the Bigger Boy Beer any service in this case. It wasn\\'t super slick on the tongue, despite the 8.4 abv. It hid the alcohol extremely well.\\t\\tDrinkability: Didn\\'t seem any different than their other beers. The smaller glass told you that you were drinking something stronger and more special, but the beer told you a different story. I could\\'ve had this all night... I had to switch merely to avoid unwanted intoxication. That abv was vicious.\\t\\tThe Broad Ripple Brew Pub continues to amaze me with their solid offerings. I love this place with all my heart. I have written about their food and I can\\'t stop talking about their beer. To me, it is obvious that they love what they do... and I enjoy reciprocating that love.',\n",

Flavor began with a malt sweetness... some grainy flavors... floral hops flavors, then meduim bitterness to finish things off --- extremently well balanced.

The Lawnmower is good and all, but the Wobbly Bob is outstanding.\\tIf they bottled this, it is all I would ever buy.\\tIf they had it on tap all the time, I would always have a growler in my fridge.\\tUnfortunately, neither of these scenarios will ever happen. I have asked...\\tBut that only increases my desire for Wobbly Bob. When it comes around, I am there. With bells on.\\t\\tAppearance: Light amber, copper. Clear. Quarter inch of coarse-bubbled head. Sufficient Lacing.\\t\\tSmell: Exceptionally fragrant. Whatever they\\'ve done here, they need to apply this to all their beers. I usually find their beers to be a little \"flat smelling.\" But the Wobbly Bob is lively and sexy. Grapefruit and pineapple cocktail, with a little dry pine sap.\\t\\tTaste: Perfectly balanced for every situation. This is my ideal beer... If have told them on several occasions and I know i\\'m not the only one that likes this. My wife is an avid fan as well.\\tThis, to me, is a world-class APA. Not too malty, not too hoppy. Exceptionally refreshing. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Perfect. I know i\\'m not really being all that helpful here... but this is my favorite style of beer and i\\'ve sampled hundreds of different takes on it. the Wobbly Bob takes the cake. Effervescent, crisp, refreshing. 5.5% is the perfect abv for this style.\\t\\tDrinkability: Infinite. I could drink this all day, every day. A perfect replacement for water. On my deathbed, I\\'ll take an IV drip of Wobbly Bob. It\\'s in my will, no shit. This is the definition of a session beer.\\t\\tI can\\'t say enough about this beer... I\\'m reviewing it months after it was on tap last... it is forever ingrained in my mind. If you live within traveling distance, watch their beer list. when it comes back around, do yourself a favor and make the trip to taste it. I promise you that you won\\'t be disappointed. Message me and i\\'ll meet you there to buy you a pint. I\\'m not kidding.',\n",

A whispy white head... more soap bubbles than foam, leaves behind some fine lace. \\t\\tAroma is like opening a bag of hops and inhaling. There is some pine and citrus, but it's mostly just the smell of a hop leaf, fresh and fragrant. There is some light toasted malt going on here as well, but it's an afterthought... more of a role player... the hops are the star here.\\t\\tThe same can be said of the flavor... like raw hop extract... but not at all bitter. Pine and citrus are right up front, and a toasted, almost nutty, malt gives a bit of backbone. The flavor is quite balanced with very little lingering bitterness and very little sweetness. \\t\\tThe beer is somewhat light in body, and being cask conditioned, very low in carbonation, and is very smooth. \\t\\tThe lighter body, smooth mouthfeel, and lower ABV, make for an incredibly drinkable beer. \\t\\tLet me be clear on this point... this is not only the best beer that I've tasted at Broad Ripple Brewpub, this is probably the best offering I've had at a brewpub in the Indianapolis area. This is an absolutely fabulous session beer, with a very distinctinve flavor. If you happen to be at Broad Ripple Brewpub and see this on the tap list, snatch it up immediately... or better yet, call me, and I will!\",\n",

I was so impressed; excellent citurs blend, orange and lemon. Pepper and other spices, sugars and mild alcohol. Fantastically balanced. The taste was much of the same. Citrus and wheat, alcohol, but some creamy sugars as well. The mouthfeel was also very good, with a smoothness and creaminess balanced well by the spice and carbonation.

Still, the lacing stayed around nicely. True color to a Wit for sure. \\t\\tSmell: Lots of lemon, a bit of grass, some pepper, a tad bit of coriander, and some cream faintly also. Nothing's too out of hand, but it's pretty balanced and good to the senses. \\t\\tTaste: I knew this wasn't going to compare to a Belgian Wit, and this is a bit lighter than most I've had. Be that as it may, it's still pretty full on flavor, with much of the lemon and citrus coming through. The finish doesn't linger as long as I wanted, but there's some spicy punchiness at the end which works in its favor. \\t\\tMouthfeel: What this may be lacking is an overload of candi sugar, because the mouthfeel is indeed a bit light. Once again, though, it isn't too spritzy, which can sometimes happen with lighter beers. Still, it could be a bit thicker. \\t\\tDrinkability: I was surprised how good this was for a Microbrewery.

Really pretty beer. HUGE rosemary aromas dominate the nose, there's no mistaking what the main draw of this beer is. Other aromas include fresh grapefruit and pine resin hops, but MAN that rosemary! Taste truly follows the nose with more resinous, sticky rosemary, a bit of pungent hops, and some sweet caramel malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy, with a medium body and good carbonation.

The mocha-colored head stays for the long haul, though not more than half an inch, and leaves some spotty lacing. \\t\\tSmell: A nice meld of bitter coffee, chocolate, charcoal, brown sugar, roasted malt, and molasses. A slight bit of citrus comes through also. \\t\\tTaste: The aroma transfers nicely, as the charcoal and roasted malt flavors balances well with the brown sugar and sweeter flavors along with the mocha and coffee.

       "  'review/text': \"Served in a very nice wine glass @ Moon River.\\t\\tAppearance: Head dissipates quickly but can be reswirled easily to recharge. Decent lacing around the glass. A little lighter than I expected, but a nice hazy yellow. Not as many bubbles as I expected either. \\t\\tSmell: Lots of odd sweetness because of the oats. Some floral and citrus hops. Pretty good balance and a novel aroma with the oats; it's like nothing I've ever really come across. \\t\\tTaste: An odd hop bite mixed with a weird sweetness that comes from the oats and not as much from the malts. I'm glad they took a chance with this, because it's pretty damn original. The initial weirdness turns into a sweet and slightly fruity hop bite and finishes with something peculiar I can't put my finger on. Thumbs up for a risky brew. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Full bodied and coating but not cloying. Carbonation levels are right too, which contribute to the aforementioned. \\t\\tDrinkability: They serve this in a wine glass, so I imagine it's about 8 to 10 ounces, and that's all you really need in one sitting, especially at the almost 10% ABV. I know it could be a lot better with more balance in everything, but as it is now I really dig it. Definitely a sipper, and it went well with my burger too.\",\n",

Definitely smells like cardamom, with a touch of lemongrass and Belgian yeast. The cardamom kinda muscles out any other aromas, and it does the same thing to that taste. Lots of floral flavors, almost reminds me of a Saison with all the cardamom, coriander, and lemongrass. Bit of bubblegum sweetness from the yeast as well. Mouthfeel is slightly cream, very smooth, with lowish carbonation (as expected from the cask serving). Overall a very unique beer, probably a bit too cardamom-heavy but I liked it nonetheless, and found myself craving some the next day!',\n",

A very, very sweet aroma is only slightly toned down by some faint grain notes, the distinct presence of alcohol, and yeast funk.\\t\\tT: Another overload of sugary sweetness consumes the palate. It's hard to find anything else because of the sugar, and hops are nowhere to be found in the taste. However, it's still very enjoyable.\\t\\tM: Solid medium body on this one. 10% ABV is definitely noticeable, but not in the normal burning way. The combination of the booze and carbonation causes this awesome tingling sensation that envelops the mouth.\\t\\tD: Even at such a high proof, it's pretty easy to sip this one down and ask for another.

My favorite hops varietal, love those big, pungent aromas of grapefruit, mandarin orange, pineapple, and pine resin, all backed up by a lightly sweet caramel malt profile. Taste follows the nose closely, lots of delicious Citra hop flavors. Very fresh and pungent. Mouth-feel is medium-thin with lowish carbonation (expected from the cask). I wish the body was a touch thicker so it could stand up to the hops a bit better, as is it's a bit watery.

Being in the most haunted city in America I guess you're bound to feel something. \\t\\tWe walked/ran into Moon River with hopes of a good meal, service, and a story to tell. we walked away with 2 of those. \\t\\tAfter waiting 10 minutes to get my beer I was excited to finally taste this brew. Its appearance was dark and creamy looking. The head was ivory and looked like it had been whipped.\\t\\tThe smell was dry with hints of cocoa and licorice. \\t\\tHowever the taste was super creamy and heavy on the tongue. It was actually very tasty and hit the spot. \\t\\tI would have liked to get it again however deciding its unlikely I'll be back anytime soon I decided to try the IPA.

The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like caramel malt, fruit, peat, grass, grapes, tea and herbs. It's a unique flavor, not quite what I expected. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has high carbonation. Drinkability is OK, would be better if the carbonation was lower.

Taste more like an English strong ale, although not a particularly bad one, just not what I'm looking for in the style. There is a bit of a staleness to it but I'm pretty sure it's new stock to my beer store so it could just be the flavor profile. \\t\\tMouthfeel seems a bit thin, and also a bit drier then I expected. \\t\\tDrinkability is OK as far as UK ales go, but it really wasn't my bag or what I was looking for. I don't think this is a classic brewery, as I've been doing a little research on the style for homebrewing purposes (at least it's not referenced in Designing Great Beers, which has extensive information on all the major traditional breweries), which would explain why it seems like a more modern interpretation of the style. .\",\n",

The nose is very pungent with sharp fruits (citrus, apples) and caramel, but little in the way of those pleasantly dark aromas that wee heavies usually have. On the palate, sharp citrus fruits and carbonation first off, followed by watery sourness and a quickly vanishing finish of little heft. This is a thin, insubstantial, overly fruity interpretation of a style that should have some muscle to it. I'm not a fan of this.\",\n",

First sip reveals a smooth slightly syrupy texture and average body with very fine rolling carbonation.

Yeah~~ I'm the first one here to review this beer in its cask-conditioned form!!!\\t\\tA: pours an amber hue, coming with very thin bubbly head... against a low carbonated body... from a very fresh barrel and just the look one should expect from a gravity-dispensed pint.\\tS: thick... preserved dates and plums, sour-sweet fruity notes, creamy maltiness... overall not too alcoholic and not too sugary~~ quite smooth and nice. But overall it's less buttery and oily than a Scottish Wee Heavy, rather like an English Barley Wine.\\tT&M: tea and caramel mingle so well on the palate upfront, slowly leading to a chewy malty, tea-ish, and slightly plum-pudding-ish aftertaste with lots of spices and mixed preserved fruits to play with. Rather dry and hoppy finish with residual fruitiness down the palate. Extremely light on the mouthfeel yet ever-changing in the flavour profile... this is a lively, vertically-structured, strong barley wine but superbly drinkable almost like an apperitif!!

Maybe Im judging a book by its cover. The beer was very foamy, over three fingers of slightly off-white head. The head retention was fair, it slide to a fizzy cap. There was a massive amount of clumpy subsequent lacing. No matter the flaws, it still looks better than average.\\t\\tThe nose is frail, nutty with a trivial caramel malt underbelly. Airy. I am not digging the aromas. It really lacks depth and power. Poor articulation as well this is Scottish? Says who? Not this beer! I didnt find the bouquet to be inviting.\\t\\tThe palate is very thin unbelievably so. Nutty. Caramel. Fusel alcohol supplies warmth and even some spice. It is weakly fruity (cherries and berries). Mild sweetness, the palate lacks depth and the flavors are not rich or well developed. Every flavor spike is disjointed. The finish is clean and empty. Good Scottish Ales give off a relaxing, charming vibe. Not this one because this is not a good Scottish Ale.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is pitiful, light in body, thin and way too carbonated. I guess I would call the mouthfeel fitting because the nose and palate were equally as poor.\\t\\tThis beer is not drinkable. It is not worth a damn. At $5 a bottle, this is a onetime purchase unless I can be convinced my bottle is old and the next is very fresh but this beer just entered the Omaha market so I assume the retail got new beer. I purchased my beer in Omaha. Not recommended.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Got this beer from the UTOBEER beerstall in the Borough Market, London. The beer itself, though not specified as such on the beer label, originates from the long-gone Devanha Brewery in Aberdeen (closed in 1987), and from some reliable sources a new company was set up in 2004 to brew beers under the Devanha names at the Isle of Skye brewery, hence the bottle in my hands now~~ I guess there must have been a wide following of this flagship beer of Devanha.\\t \\tBottle-conditioned, it comes in a brown, 500ml bottle, with a BB date of JAN 06.\\tA: using Fuller's ESB goblet, the beer pours a decent, very dark ruby hue, bringing an effervescent, rocky and fluffy off-white head which very slowly settles down, while several layers of tight lacing are left along the way; extremely fine carbonation detected against light.\\tS: medium-textured maltiness upfront, with that slightly sour-sweet edge of crushed-grains/raw barleys, a mildly brown-sugary note at the back along with pretty pleasant, sour nuttiness and a lovely tinge of cocoa; there's also some fruity aroma, but very restrained, and more like dried berries. Overall the aroma is quite intense, malt-focused, but not so complex.\\tT: quite sharp mouthfeel at the first sip, overpowering the senses of my tastebuds, leaving just a lingering aftertaste of crushed grains and, in particular, raw hazelnuts. Better prepared for the second sip, and also given a much softer, even creamy, texture now, what was missing in the first sip is now crystal clear--a smooth flow of juicy maltiness prevails on the palate, not sweet, but raw-nutty and grainy, gradually leading to a kind of richer, slightly buttery and nutty aftertaste; turning drier and leaving a just a hint of smoky/moderately roasted taste of dark malts in the end, faintly coffee-bean-ish as well.\\tM&D: pretty balanced the mouthfeel is--lively at the front but going softer as the flavour develops and the beer warms up a bit. Overall this is a moderately tasty Scottish ale, not too bold or too complex, but for me it's as easy to drink amongst varieties of Scottish Ales as a Best Bitter in generally English ales. I'm happy to bump into this revived brew thanks to the Isle of Skye's efforts~~\",\n",

The beer itself can be bought at the hotel on bottle all the year round but they only have it on cask from April through to September. Unfortunately I visited the hotel in December and the bottle was the only option.\\t\\tThe beer poured a lovely brown colour with a dark-cream coloured head. The nose was dominated by roasted malts, nuts and burnt caramel with a slight hint of berries.\\t\\tThese fragrances carried through to the taste, a bitter taste of hops is then followed by the sweet taste of caramel, hops and nuts followed again by a slightly bitter aftertaste of berries. What an amazing combination and a perfect variety of bitter and sweet flavours tingling the taste buds.\\t\\tI would happily drink this all the year round if I could get it. It's almost worth taking a trip to North Uist just to try this. A truly excellent beer, better than anything the Skye brewery has produced commercially, I hope they release this to the open market.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Having tried this way back in 1998, I was very pleased to see it in a small shop whilst travelling home from a recent trip to the UK mainland. I remember enjoying the pint I had before, it was on tap, but I couldn't remember it well enough to review it.\\t\\tThe beer poured a nice bronzish-brownish colour with a nice thin head that died off about half way through the pint. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. The same could be said about scent from the bottle, a mainly hoppy nose with some very faint fruity hints, but again nothing startling.\\t\\tThe taste was where this beer started to turn for the better. A very nice hoppy taste along with a nutty and biscuity taste, it was very nice but quite difficult to describe, quite dry for a beer. This then went down very nicely leaving a slightly fruity, but very pleasant aftertaste, this is one of the nicest aftertastes I have every had from a beer. It lasted a while in the mouth and this made the next sip all the more pleasant.\\t\\tThe great aftertaste meant that I really did savour this beer and took quite a while longer to drink it than most beers I sample. This is highly drinkable, too drinkable, why did I only buy two bottles??? If you are lucky enough to find this then I recomend purchasing a case.\",\n",

The typical Scottish ales slightly exotic maltiness makes a big entrance, along with a thicker texture of fruitiness and grains. Full-bodied on the nose, albeit a bit overly sweet.\\tT: refreshing and dryish texture of peat-smoked maltiness and raw-nuttiness dominate the palate upfront; turning incredibly smooth afterwards, backed by the lingering flow of mild nuttiness sustaining firmly at the back along with a little herbal touch, but showing little sign of that sweetish aroma on the nose, thus quite welcomed. Its said to be brewed with porridge oats, and with that indication I do find this one a bit different from other pale Scottish ale Ive tasted, softer on the palate, though they all are a bit timid in terms of flavour and hop presence.\\tM&D: as smooth as you could get from any pale ale, but it also remains lively as the bubbly texture provides good backbone. Medium-bodied, while the texture is a bit too light. Overall, a quality, but quiet brew in need of more flavour for my preference, and I really fail to pinpoint where the oats make their greater contribution than perhaps the obvious smoothness.

A dark cream coloured head formed immediately, but then also died within about 10 seconds and left no residue, this looked like I had a pint of pepsi.\\t\\tThe smell of roast oats, I felt it wasn't sweet enough to be malts, with a faint hint of coffee and a faint spicy, fruity smell.\\t\\tThis continued onto the taste, however I was surprised at the bitterness of the beer. I was expecting a porter style with a dominant sweet malt but instead I got a bitter taste similar to a stout (mackesons not guinness) with a great deal of roastiness, slight hint of coffee. This swirled nicely in the mouth but then came the best part, the aftertaste was nicer than the initial taste. A mixed plate of dried fruit, possibly dried figs, and a nice bitter sweet taste from the spices made this a very pleasant pint.\\t\\tI did enjoy it, but one did not leave me with a desire for another, instead I simply moved on to try some of the other beers I purchased. It is very drinkable, but not enough to capture my taste throughout an evening.\",\n",

Taste is a little light, starts watery then the flavors kick in. Carbonation is a little too sparkly. This is an interesting beer. Very light for a porter at the start but then it makes a comeback. Finishes with a heavy molasees and roasted malt but a dry hop bitterness. Kind of backwards for a porter. It tastes like something diluted then bottled and shipped. No thickness and syrupyness usually associated with a fine porter. They may have to name this the backwards porter. I'm quite dissapointed with this brewery overall. How did the BOTMC find these guys?\",\n",

Nice roasted malt, a bit softer I suppose somewhat like an oatmeal stout. A hint of oak vs just a strong bourbon aroma. A lot of stouts are a bit lacking in aroma. This beer has a really strong aroma which is really nice. \\t\\tAt room temp it's starting to have a nice coffee nose. Interesting how the blending of flavors works here. Of course this beer is brewed with coffee so this should be there.\\t\\tt. Starting this beer it's way too cold, which was my mistake. At first not much going on here, nice finish, but I'll have to let this warm a few minutes. \\t\\tOK warmer and drinkable. This reminds me a bit of an oatmeal stout (I somewhat doubt there is any oatmeal in it). It's got that almost bready malt flavor mixed with a good bit of burnt malt. This gives it a nice hint of chocolate along with an oak finish. I'm a bit disappointed as I wanted to taste some bourbon in this, but instead they went with a really mellow bourbon/oak flavor. Nothing is over powering, perhaps the most balanced bourbon aged beer I've had. I want to rank this poorly for not being what I had hoped, but truth be told this just isn't an imperial stout at least at heart and darn if it isn't tasty. I'd like to score it a 4.25 on taste, but 4 will have to do. \\t\\tNow room temp. A general coffee flavor and nose is coming into play. Odd that a beer brewed with coffee didn't come out with it faster, but again this beer is amazingly well blended. They wanted a balanced brew and they have done it.\\t\\tM. Silky and smooth. Not sure oddly enough what the bite is, could be alcohol (but at 7.5% it isn't all that stout) or some hops or some mix, but good stuff over all. I like my stouts a touch thicker, but that isn't what they were going for here.\\t\\tD. Not a session beer but you could certainly have a few over the course of the night.\\t\\tSince these weights don't always reflect me views. This is a solid beer and by far the best I've had from the BBC. I'm not sure how many bottles are out there, but if you see it I'd certainly give it a try.\",\n",

Thanks, buddy:) I'm trying this one first. Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint glass.\\t\\tAppearance: Golden orange with a light and fluffy 1 finger head at the pour. No retention - the head faded to a skim within moments. Liquid is cloudy with some sediment floating around amidst the little carbonation bubbles. \\t\\tSmell: The first sniff is filled with very forward citrusy hops. As the head fades, so does the hop smell, giving way to grainy maltiness.\\t\\tTaste/Mouthfeel: The taste is grassier than the smell, and the bitterness is more pine sap-like. The grains taste crunchy, as if they were lightly toasted. There carbonation adds brightness, but it still has a watery feel on the tongue. The carbonation is more noticed in the aftertaste, strangely. \\t\\tDrinkability: High - definitely could be a session beer.\\t\\tOverall not a bad beer.

I've always liked stopping at BBC in Louisville and it appears there starting to bottle special editions so I thought I'd give it a try. This tripel is definitely closer to the abbey version than the trappist versions as it finishes quite sweet. The esters really overpower and spicy phenols also. But what it lacks in phenols it somewhat makes up for in ester complexity - to a degree. It could use a bit more hop as it borders on cloying. And in that respect it almost seems like a not-so-clean strong golden ale (strong sweetness & esters). I don't regret having picked it up, but probably won't be purchasing this one again. It was good enough thought that I would consider purchasing another special from BBC.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Very thin head, practically gone before its there, light tan in hue. Lightly filmy liquid, the metallic orange base favors yellow over brown by a hair, the minuscule bubbles more dispersed than in beads. At first the nose suggests earth, peat, wood ash and tar before settling into only semi-sweet banana, bubblegum, spiced oranges, biscuit and corn meal, the apple, pear, white grape scents in turn not overdone, overall marked most by gentle weight and persistent outwards expansive pressure. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has a slow, steady churn to it which slackens the pacing and at times makes it feel heavier. Drier than expected, with more tangy bite as well, pleasing emphasis on lemon, orange and a touch of white grapefruit citrus. Here the malts rise a notch, offering mocha to cocoa dust. The yeastiness seems kind of regal, a tough sort of breadiness, not going to pretty itself up with too much honey or banana notes. Some granola or cereal in there. Same pear, apple, peach, grape fruit flavors, pleasant enough but tending to veer away during the mid-palate. Not a lot of \"give\" here, stylistically appears best suited for the dinner table than casual sipping.',\n",

Surprisingly solid aroma of malt and hops. Smooth and highly flavorful, the balance of the malt and hops were beyond my expectations. Smooth yet crisp and very refreshing. One of the best session beers I have had, ever. Plenty of aroma, flavor, balance and complexity to go around. It continues to amaze me how beers like this are not more popular in the main stream that seems consumed by Big Beer.\\t\\tZum wohl!',\n",

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, smoked meat, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, subtle smoke, and smoked meat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Based on the latest reviews of growlers this one seems to have fallen off sharply upon being growlered. I had this one on-tap awhile back at the brewery and found it to be quite enjoyable. Just didn't have the same feeling on this one in the growler. A lot of the flavors were very light on this one as it almost tasted watered-down in a way. Worth trying for the tick, but that is about it on the growler.\",\n",

It doesn't dominate the flavor of the beer but you know it's there and it balances perfectly with the chocolate and roasted flavors.\",\n",

Poured massively dark red brown with a one and a half finger cream colored head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass.

Lightly tanned frothy head with good stability.\\t\\tGood balance of caramel and floral hop aromas. Certainly fresh and interesting while also giving the impression of a substantial beer backing it up. \\t\\tGreat balance in this. It's got an old fashioned malt base to it that I don't get in a lot of beers now. Big refreshing light malt sweetness (if that makes sense) with a lasting peppery bitterness.\\t\\tQuite nice and a very enjoyable example of an amber ale. Strong without being overwhelming or intimidating.\",\n",

Really disappointing look, to be honest.\\t\\tNose is mostly sweet, almost overtly so, with some slight earthy hop characters and a slight nut character. Mostly there's a sweetness reminiscent of extract or unfermented wort. It's not all that good.\\t\\tTaste is also awkward. Here, in addition to the sweetness and the earthiness, comes a slightly spicy Belgian yeast note, leaving a residual pepper and acetone note on the finish. It dries out the palate, leaving it astringent and stretched. Sweetness has dropped a little bit, at least, but the other characters clash in anarchy, and don't meld to make coherence, nor bounce off each other to create interest.\\t\\tDoesn't work at all for me. The Belgian characters warp the palate unpleasantly, and the earthy bitterness doesn't do it any favours. This is a genuine miss for Yeastie Boys, who do some of the most interesting beers coming out of New Zealand (and hence, the world). But this is a pretty much failed experiment, for me.\",\n",

Pretty damn fine.\\t\\tNose is predominantly roasty. Nice dark chocolate notes giving sweet and toasty in equal measure. Slight floral hop notes lend it a mild sour touch, and the back is all caramel grain. Very nice.\\t\\tTaste starts out all hoppy, with enjoyable floral notes, touch of pine and mint. Lasts until the mid where the roasty grain takes hold and gives it a mildly sour cocoa throttle. Rich chocolatey notes on the finish for a decent roast that doesn't quite fill the palate with its goodness. The nice hops return on the very back with more of a fresh, lighter bitterness than one might have expected from the rest of the palate, but it leaves me wanting more of a robust portery finish. Still, the hoppy/roasty balance overall is definitely a winner.\\t\\tA bit too much fizz, but it's not harsh, nicely padded by the decent body.\\t\\tGood take on the porter/IBA trade-off here.

The finish is really hoppy, but a bit different than anything else I've run into. A bit soapy and fruity, but still incredibly bitter.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium body with aggressive yet fluffy carbonation and a slightly dry finish.\\t\\tOverall: I'm really glad I got to try this, but I don't know that I'll have another. Could have used a little bit more balance.\",\n",

Good staying power there. Looks pretty good. \\t\\tS: I was expecting worse. New Zealand's a long way away, and I assumed this would be old and wasted by the time it arrived. Not quite so. Yes, there's some fade, but I still get a nice, bright, perhaps Cascade-like nose and a balanced malt body--not too sweet, like some faded IPAs or DIPAs can get. Still, the straw-like malt predominates. \\t\\tS: Things come out somewhat better in the taste. There are still some powdery, citrusy notes in the middle, with a bitter but not overwhelming finish. I get a noticeable diacetyl flavor, but I think it works alright, right at the threshold. Overall, it's actually pretty good, despite an assumed age. \\t\\tM: Good carbonation and moderate body deliver 7% ABV pretty nicely. Typical, in a good way. \\t\\tO: I was skeptical buying an expensive IPA from a faraway land, but this wasn't bad. No need to go switching from your favorite fresh place, but I'm glad to see NZ putting out pretty quality beer. If I could get this fresh on the regular, I'd be all over it, for sure.\",\n",

It was wary of it being yet another so-so imported macro lager, and it may be that, but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Pretty simple flavors and aromas, but it's marked with a very nice honey flavor. Very basic mouthfeel, but very drinkable, and an excellent complement to the Ethiopian food.

So I eagerly awaited ripping open the can..\\t\\tPoured a sexy looking light orange, looked fantastic, but, to my severe disappointment, no hop aroma erupting from my glass. It's there, sure. But you have to seek it out. A little bit of pine, smaller amount of grapefruit and grassiness. Malt notes overrun this beer. A bit dextrinous, caramel, well-balanced, but not a standard bearer. Not what I was looking for with a new NW DIPA. A bit sticky. \\t\\tSomebody got the better end of that deal..not us.\",\n",

Not much in the way of bubbles coming up to refuel the beer, but I could care less.\\t\\tS- Smell isn't quite as pungent in the citric area as other DIPA's but it does have that good fresh smell that you get from most good IPAs.\\t\\tT/M- Well this one definitely has a strong bitter hop flavor in the front end. Again it is not quite as citric in the flavor as other similar DIPAs which is what I love in DIPA's but it is still good when it comes to pure hops and the bitterness. Astringency of this brew is pretty prevalent. I can taste the malts trying to push through the strong bitterness but in the end the hops prevail. I would say this beer is definitely geared toward people who like their IPA's pretty hot, bitter, and lower on the sweet citric and malt back end.\\t\\tD- One that I wouldn't want more then one of in a sitting since it is a fairly big beer and it goes down kinda heavy. But great beer none-the-less. By far one of the best (might be the only for all I can remember) DIPA from a can.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Served in a shaker pint at Wyatt's in Albany, OR, Yankee Clipper IPA is a hazy, bright burnt golden orange, with a small, thick, eggshell head that is long lasting and leaves lots of super thick, foamy lace. \\t\\tThe aroma is strong and very piney and earthy, but there is some depth to it that I find unusual in NW IPAs, where it's a little musty. Intriguing for sure. \\t \\tThe taste is a real blast of hops, and again, while it initially seems like the familiar NW piney hops, it in fact is a unique taste, which is very cedar like, like a humidor. I love it! The finish is bitter and very dry. Wow, in my mind this one really stands out among the many hop juice IPAs out there. I only had one pint though, so time will tell if it was a fluke. \\t\\tThe mouthefeel was very creamy, with a medium body. \\t\\tThis was so tasty, once I worked out what I was tasting, the second half went down way to fast! Very fresh and tangy, if you like hop juice, this is the one. I don't get to drink this nearly as often as I'd like...\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"One of my favorite things about the annual Spring Beer & Wine Festival (Portland) is that Calapooia brings this beer year after year. I discovered it in 2007 and have made a point of having it multiple times ever since. Finally sat down to review a full glass (12 oz+/-) from the tap, my first beer on Friday.\\t\\tA: Pours a slightly murky amber with a thin film of creamy whiteness, clinging as a slightly thicker ring. Little sticking flecks, otherwise no lace.\\t\\tS: Huge pepper aroma, opens the nose immediately. The scent of chopped jalapeos pops from the glass; it's like a plate of nachos covered in pepper slices. Not much else, but when it's a 'chile' beer, it's about the peppers first and foremost for me.\\t\\tT: Those peppers hit quickly, Serrano/Anaheim/Jalapeo warmth rolls in waves. Whatever hopping is minimized, but a bready/crackery malt does balance the heat. \\t\\tM: Maybe a little thin, but the oily warmth the peppers bringing fills the mouth within seconds, chafing the troat on the way down. Carbonation is mild, lingering fresh pepper is actually refreshing.\\t\\tD: I recognize that this beer isn't for everyone (given that I saw several people dump full tasters after one small sip); I also know that it's been a People's Choice winner, too. About as polarizing as it gets, I am in the camp that loves this stuff; in fact I'm salivating right now as I type my notes. Proceed with caution, but absolutely worth seeking if you like peppery heat in your beer.\",\n",

Clear. Full two-inch head the recedes to a thin layer but leaves nice lacing.\\tVery light overall flavor. Site notes a mix of pale and darker malts. The former provide the greater amount of flavor, with the latter offering a mild to moderate bittering quality on the finish and the fairly long lingering.
